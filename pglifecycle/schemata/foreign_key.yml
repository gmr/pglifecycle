  match_type:
    title: Match Type
    description: >
      A value inserted into the referencing column(s) is matched against the
      values of the referenced table and referenced columns using the given
      match type. There are three match types: FULL, PARTIAL, and SIMPLE
      (which is the default). FULL will not allow one column of a multicolumn
      foreign key to be null unless all foreign key columns are null; if they
      are all null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced
      table. SIMPLE allows any of the foreign key columns to be null; if any of
      them are null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced
      table. PARTIAL is not yet implemented.
    enum:
      - FULL
      - PARTIAL

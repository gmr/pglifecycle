title: Foreign Data Wrapper

  Foreign Data Wrappers provide a standardized way of handling access to remote data stores.

      The name of the foreign data wrapper to be created.

    type: string
  handler:
    title: Handler
    description: >
      The name of a previously registered function that will be called to retrieve
      the execution functions for foreign tables. The handler function must take no
      arguments, and its return type must be fdw_handler.

      It is possible to create a foreign-data wrapper with no handler function,
      but foreign tables using such a wrapper can only be declared, not accessed.
    type: string
  validator:
    title: Validator
    description: >
      The name of a previously registered function that will be called to check
      the generic options given to the foreign-data wrapper, as well as options
      for foreign servers, user mappings and foreign tables using the foreign-data
      wrapper. If no validator function or NO VALIDATOR is specified, then options
      will not be checked at creation time. (Foreign-data wrappers will possibly
      ignore or reject invalid option specifications at run time, depending on
      the implementation.) The validator function must take two arguments: one
      of type text[], which will contain the array of options as stored in the
      system catalogs, and one of type oid, which will be the OID of the system
      catalog containing the options. The return type is ignored; the function
      should report invalid options using the ereport(ERROR) function.
    type: string
  options:
    title: Options
    description: >
      This clause specifies options for the new foreign-data wrapper. The allowed
      option names and values are specific to each foreign data wrapper and are
      validated using the foreign-data wrapper's validator function. Option names
      must be unique.

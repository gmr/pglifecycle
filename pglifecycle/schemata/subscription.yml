    properties:
      copy_data:
        title: Copy Data
        description: >
          Specifies whether the existing data in the publications that are
          being subscribed to should be copied once the replication starts.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      create_slot:
        title: Create Replication Slot
        description: >
          Specifies whether the command should create the replication slot on
          the publisher.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      enabled:
        title: Replication Enabled
        description: >
          Specifies whether the subscription should be actively replicating, or
          whether it should be just setup but not started yet.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      slot_name:
        title: Slot Name
        description: >
          Name of the replication slot to use. The default behavior is to use
          the name of the subscription for the slot name.

          When slot_name is set to NONE, there will be no replication slot
          associated with the subscription. This can be used if the replication
          slot will be created later manually. Such subscriptions must also
          have both enabled and create_slot set to false.

        title: Connect
        description: >
          Specifies whether the subscription should connect to the publisher at
          all. Setting this to false will change default values of enabled,
          create_slot and copy_data to false.

          It is not allowed to combine connect set to false and enabled,
          create_slot, or copy_data set to true.

  check_option:
    title: Check Option
    description: |
      This option controls the behavior of automatically updatable views.
      When this option is specified, INSERT and UPDATE commands on the
      view will be checked to ensure that new rows satisfy the view-defining
      condition (that is, the new rows are checked to ensure that they are
      visible through the view). If they are not, the update will be
      rejected. If the CHECK OPTION is not specified, INSERT and UPDATE
      commands on the view are allowed to create rows that are not visible
      through the view.

      When it is set to LOCAL, new rows are only checked against the
      conditions defined directly in the view itself. Any conditions defined
      on underlying base views are not checked (unless they also specify
      the CHECK OPTION).

      When it is set to CASCADED, new rows are checked against the conditions
      of the view and all underlying base views. If the CHECK OPTION is
      specified, and neither LOCAL nor CASCADED is specified, then CASCADED
      is assumed.
